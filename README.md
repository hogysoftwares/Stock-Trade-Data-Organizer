# Stock-Trade-Data-Organizer

FlexTrade, a FinTech company based in New York, posted a challenge to improve a stock trading organization tool C++ program. This program is designed to read stock trade data from a file, and organize the data needed to calculate the Volume Weighted Average Prices (VWAP). The challenge asked for comments about the original code, an improved implementation of the program, and asked about how this program could be tested effecitvely.

This repository includes my submission that passed the challenge. The following have been included:
  - The original C++ program with my comments on how it can be improved
  - My own implementation of the program
  - A testing procedure plan that explains how this program can be verified effectively
